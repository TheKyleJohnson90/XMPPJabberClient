## XMPP Jabber Client Privacy Policy

XMPP Jabber Client is an XMPP client that connects to an XMPP server. XMPP Jabber Client will never upload data to the source developer. The only execption to this rule is data collected after a crash. This data will be send via your own XMPP account but never without your explicit consent.

XMPP Jabber Client or any of its developers don’t have control over the data you send through the app. However the following data might get uploaded to your XMPP provider:

#### Data uploaded to your XMPP provider

*   Messages. This includes text messages, images and other files
*   Your avatar / profile picture
*   Your public keys for the OMEMO encryption

#### What does not get uploaded

*   Your contacts. Conversations only asks permissions to read your contact to show the profile pictures and names of the corresponding XMPP contacts. Your contacts are never published anywhere. **If you opt-out of this permission Conversations will work just fine.**

#### Using the conversations.im provider

If you use the _conversations.im_ please refer to their [privacy policy](https://account.conversations.im/privacy/).

**Using the conversations.im XMPP provider is optional. Conversations will connect to almost any other XMPP provider.**
